You will find in this project : 

  - The notebook we submit to the professor at the end of the challenge.
  - A PDF of our small report who explain the basic stuff around this topic.
  - One PCA in two dimension just to help visualise the problem.
  - One folder "debug_plot_analysis" with 8 plot of the "real" hypnogramm and what our model predict all along the sleep.
  - One confusion matrix image after our LOSO cross validation.
  - One json file with the optimal weight for each stage (more information in the jupyter notebook).
  - One json file with every missprediction on the N1 stage (that was the hardest point in the project).
